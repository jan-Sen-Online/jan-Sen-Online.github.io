<h2>jan_Sen is now online</h2>
<p>Hi! Welcome to my cobbled together Frankenstein of a website. I'm a 16-year-old Australian teenager who likes trying and playing around with a variety of things, like filmmaking, 3D art, writing and much more. I go by jan Sen online and I use any pronouns. Here are my <a href="/:x socials">:socials</a>.</p>
<h2>:x socials</h2>
<p>My Letterboxd for my film bro opinions, my Twitter for random thought and quips, and my Github, so you can see and use the code on this site.</p>
